		<div class="question">
			<b>Tengwar?</b> <br>
			Yes, you saw this in the lord or the ring movies, it's the alphabet used in the one ring's inscription. J.R.R Tolkien invented this as the alphabet used by the elves. More info can be found at the wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengwar">Tengwar</a>
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>Is this a translator from english to elvish languages?</b> <br>
			Nope, all this page does is writes your english, spanish, or elvish words in Tengwar.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>Can't i just change the font to write english words in Tengwar?</b><br>
			No, unfortunately most tengwar fonts available have the characters on the wrong places; in other words, typing an A doesn't produce an A. This page uses a character map and other interesting rules to find the best way to write the words you input using tengwar.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>What is this busines with preceding/trailing vowels?</b><br>
			When writing in tengwar vowels go on top of consonants, this means that all those little markings you see on top of the regular letters are actually vowels. Generally speaking they are 2 ways to write/read this: from top to bottom which is covered by the preceding vowel "mode" and from bottom to top which arranges the writing to use trailing vowels. Preceding works better with English words, and Trailing with Spanish words because of the way words separate into syllables in those languages. Sindarin and Quenya are elvish languages, they are written with preceding and trailing vowels respectively.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>Where are my Mordor Black Speach, Beleriand, etc modes?</b><br>
			I didn't go that deep, but there are other transcribers on the internet that might support the mode you want. That said you can type <i>"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, Ash nazg thrakatulûk, agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."</i> and the output should be close to proper if not spot on.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>Did you just type that from memory?</b><br>
			LOL NO.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>What does "Nuances" do?</b> <br>
			It changes some letters and strings to adjust to commonly accepted English and Spanish modes. For example how c, k and handled is different.
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>What about numbers? Can you do numbers?</b><br>
			Yes, numbers are supported
		</div>
		<div class="question">
			<b>But why are numbers backwards?</b><br>
			That's how they are supposed to be written in tengwar, from right to left, i kid you not.
		</div>	
		<div class="question">
			<b>Can i use this for a tatoo?</b><br>
			Yes, as long as you assume complete resposibility for any typos and/or later regrets. If you must do it, please check other transcribers availabe online to make sure the words you are about to permanently mark yourself with are proper.
